It helps you get started by providing you with everything you need for a lightweight Silex application. By the way, [Silex][silex] is a PHP micro-framework.\r\n\r\nThis project embeds an HTML5Boilerplate structure with Twitterboostrap 2 for the frontend. Regarding the backend, the basics is already setup for you. There is some templating, routing, cache, controllers, basic settings and a solid directory structure.\r\n\r\nIt's very similar to [Silex Kitchen Edition][silexkitchen], but with less stuff. Oh, it's open source, and it's [on Github][githubproject].\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n1) Download composer : \r\n\r\n\tcurl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php\r\n\r\n2) Download the latest version of the source code and of its dependencies :\r\n\r\n\tphp composer.phar create-project keirua/silex-bootstrap YourProject/\r\nwhere YourProject/ is the directory of your future project.\r\n\r\n\r\nDone ! You can now start hacking into YourProject/src/app.php. There already are 2 routes, / and /hello/plop\r\n\r\nIf you don't know Silex, I'm pretty sure the [documentation][silexdoc] can be useful.\r\n\r\nDirectory structure\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nThe directory structure is the following\r\n\r\n\tsrc/\r\n\t  views/\r\n\tapp/\r\n\t  cache/\r\n\t  logs/\r\n\tweb/\r\n\tvendor/\r\n\r\n**src/** is the root of your code. Create some routes in app.php, and put the templates in the views directory. A layout file based on HTML5Boilerplate is already there, it can be of use.\r\n\r\n**app/** contains all the settings of the application. Everything is in a file named bootstrap.php. If you want to add more service providers from Silex, do it there.\r\n\r\n**web/** contains everything which is exposed. Make sure your web server only serves this directory to people. It also contains all the public assets : css, js and images.\r\n\r\n**vendor/** contains all the dependencies of the project. The dependencies are listed in composer.json.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis tool was made with love by [KeiruaProd][keiruaprod].\r\n\r\n[silex]: http://silex.sensiolabs.org/\r\n[silexdoc]: http://silex.sensiolabs.org/documentation\r\n[silexkitchen]: https://github.com/lyrixx/Silex-Kitchen-Edition\r\n[githubproject]: https://github.com/Keirua/silex-bootstrap\r\n[keiruaprod]: http://www.keiruaprod.fr","name":"Silex-bootstrap","tagline":"A ready to get started Silex project.
